# MVVM_Sample_Project

Work in progress.

The purpose of this project was to work my way through protocol oriented MVVM.

Networks with an Image Search API.
Extends UIImageView to asychronously downloads images and updates the UI on the main thread.
Data persistence with Core Data.

Future Features:
